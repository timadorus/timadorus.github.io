Finally out for Halloween: The Timadorus Project gets the first shipment of web site overhaul. Now served by Github.io and build using Jekyll, the dark times of server rot and big hurdles for editing should be over.

New content will be added in the next weeks. First the old content will be restored (after translating all into english) and then a compehensive overview of the components in Timadorus will follow.

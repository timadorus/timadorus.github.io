# Introducing Timadorus

*The Road to Timadorus ist paved with many cobbles. Each
single one was broken from the living rock by a living person, and formed with
much care and effort.*

## Phase I (2006 - 2018): Student Project

Timadorus started a project to build a playable Massive Multiplayer Online
Roleplaying Game (MMORPG). Initiated as a project course of the department of
computer science of the <a title="Website of the University of Applied Sciences,
Hamburg" href="http://www.haw-hamburg.de">UAS Hamburg</a>, focussed
for a number of years on the creation of software either to create
MMORPS or the their content. MMORPGs represent a highly complex
software systems and contain components that cover nearly every field
in computer science (e.g. 3D real time graphics, networks, data bases,
security, artificial intelligence, physics simulation and audio processing).</p>

The complete source code of the components written during the academic
project are be released under a Free Software/Open Source (FOSS)
license. All components that are provided by other projects are
exclusively released under FOSS licenses as well. Also, all media date
(images, sounds, etc.) must be released under similar licenses as
well, to be included in the project.

Code that was made available during this phase can be accessed via the
[GitHub organisation page](https://github.com/timadorus). A few
components are not available due to outstanding licensing issues.

There is some [more information](/phase1) on the first phase of the project.
